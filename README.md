**Why data science projects fail revisited** [(link)](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-data-science-projects-fail-revisited-85fe242c3931)
- Many projects are not iterated quickly enough and are then suddenly shut down or quietly declared as completed

    - Focus on Augmenting People, Not Replacing Them
    - Plan for Knowledge Transfer
    - Choose Transparent AI Solutions
    
**Why Most AI Projects Fail** [(link)](https://www.datarobot.com/blog/why-most-ai-projects-fail/)
- Science project sharks
    - “Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do (names some niche geek-fetish)?!”
    - BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals),
- Breakdown in communication
- Fail before you start
- Not having a data warrior
- Homegrown talent/software
- Start simple!

**Why You’re Not Getting Value from Your Data Science** [(link)](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-youre-not-getting-value-from-your-data-science)
- the data is a mess.
- In its rawest form, even clean data is too overwhelming and complex to be understood at first glance, even by experts.
- due to the time it takes to understand, formulate, and process data for a machine learning problem, machine learning experts often instead focus on the later parts of the pipeline—trying different models
- While business experts are coming up with problems, machine learning experts cannot always keep up.
- machine learning experts often didn’t build their work around the final objective—deriving business value.
- the machine learning experts wanted to spend their time building models, not processing massive datasets or translating business problems into prediction problems
- the current technological landscape, both commercial and academic, focuses on enabling more sophisticated models

    - Ineffective coordination of teams across the organisation
    - Dependency on legacy systems
    - Lack of sponsorship from top management

**Why do 87% of data science projects never make it into production?** [(link)](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/)
- throw money at a problem or put a technology in
- we don’t have the right leadership support, to make sure we create the conditions for success
- most organizations are highly siloed (in terms of data - Laszlo), with owners who are simply not collaborating and leaders who are not facilitating communication
- take those insights, and they flip them over the wall, now you’re asking an engineer to rewrite a data science model created by a data scientist
- because nobody owned it
- educate the business leaders across the organization
